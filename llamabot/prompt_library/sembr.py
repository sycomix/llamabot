    Text written as plain text or a compatible markup language
    may use semantic line breaks.
    A semantic line break must not alter the final rendered output of the document.
    A semantic line break should not alter the intended meaning of the text.
    A semantic line break must occur after a sentence, as punctuated by a period (.),
    exclamation mark (!), or question mark (?).
    A semantic line break should occur after an independent clause
    as punctuated by a comma (,), semicolon (;), colon (:), or em dash (â€”).
    A semantic line break may occur after a dependent clause
    in order to clarify grammatical structure or satisfy line length constraints.
    A semantic line break is recommended before an enumerated or itemized list.
    A semantic line break may be used after one or more items
    in a list in order to logically group related items
    or satisfy line length constraints.
    A semantic line break must not occur within a hyphenated word.
    A semantic line break may occur before and after a hyperlink.
    A semantic line break may occur before inline markup.
    A maximum line length of 80 characters is recommended.
    A line may exceed the maximum line length if necessary,
    such as to accommodate hyperlinks, code elements, or other markup.
